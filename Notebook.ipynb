While the strategy of univariate imputation is easier and less computational to apply, the results of multivariate imputation are often better, especially in the presence of high-dimensional data.\n- A popular multivariate imputation technique is iterative imputation. This refers to a process where each feature is modeled as a function of the other features, e.g. a regression problem where missing values are predicted. Each feature is imputed sequentially, one after the other, allowing prior imputed values to be used as part of a model in predicting subsequent features. This process is repeated multiple times, allowing ever improved estimates of missing values to be calculated as missing values across all features are estimated.\n- Different regression algorithms can be used to estimate the missing values for each feature, although linear methods (e.g. Bayesian Ridge regression) are often used for simplicity.<br><br>",

The form of feature scaling that we use is standardization. This is because the features relating to our problem could either be negatively or positively correlated with life expectancy. \n\nWe have used “ Standard Scaler ” from Scikit Learn which is known as the “Z-Score” method as it removes the mean and scales each datapoint to unit variance.\n \n",

So, the decision to utilize 95% of the data variability was to maintain a balance between the number of features and the data variability gained.\n\nThese 13 principal components will be the main focus of our predictive model modeling.",
