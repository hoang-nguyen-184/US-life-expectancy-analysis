# A Data-Driven Approach to Life Expectancy Prediction

Time series prediction has been the dominate model for life expectancy prediction questions. We at Team AI propose a data driven approach to increase the interpretability of predictions obtained as well as increase in other benefits such as speed and accuracy.

- Purpose: to build a data-driven solution for predicting life expectancy based on socio-economic factors.
- Applied data cleaning, data imputation and PCA to reduce 1443-dimensions tabular data to 7 principal components.
- Applied cross-validation and hypothesis testing to select the most suitable regression model.
- Achieved 99% similarity to state-of-the-art forecasting model (ARIMA).
